I'm Mikey Lombardi, and this is a place where I work through my thoughts by posting them. I've been
a full-time open source developer and writer since 2017. I write games, documentation, software
tools and libraries.

I spend my spare time with my family and friends, writing, gardening, lifting weights, and trying
to figure out how I can make better or more interesting tools and toys.
